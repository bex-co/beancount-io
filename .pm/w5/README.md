# w5 — General adoption worker queue (worker1)

**Worker:** worker1 — general-purpose adoption worker; accepts the next highest-impact milestone across packages, topics, and A1/A2/A3 rather than owning a permanent specialty. Existing milestones retain their historical order and source.

## Milestones

- [x] **m1** — Ledger sidebar: richer rows, honest states, post-create landing (9 tasks) ← from /pm-brainstorm 2026-08-17
- [x] **m2** — Accessibility pass on /ledger + gallery (8 tasks) ← from /pm-brainstorm 2026-08-17 — sequenced after m1 (both touch `LedgerItem`)

- [x] **m3** — [Install and verify the eight customer ledger skills](./done/m3/README.md) (8 tasks) ← approved `/pm-brainstorm for w5`; materialized 2026-09-12
- [x] **m4** — [Make real MCP agent journeys reproducible](./done/m4/README.md) (9 tasks) — rescoped 2026-09-15 to the hosted MCP endpoint ← promoted core scope of [w2/009](../w2/blocked/009.md); user routed to w5 on 2026-09-12
- [ ] **m5** — [Verify and complete shipped MCP accounting prompts](./blocked/m5/README.md) (9 tasks) — **blocked:** t001–t008 done and Codex measured ([w4/960](../w4/done/960.md)); the closeout needs `d812112f6` deployed and seen live ← approved w5 proposal; reconciled with shipped [w2/008](../w2/done/008.md) on 2026-09-13 — depends on m4 closeout

- [x] **m6** — [Authenticate live prices and report refresh failures](./done/m6/README.md) (7 tasks) ← PRFAQ003 launch gaps; requested 2026-09-21
- [x] **m7** — [Expose live-price provenance in ordinary reports](./done/m7/README.md) (6 tasks) ← PRFAQ003 launch gaps; requested 2026-09-21
- [x] **m8** — [Validate and release authenticated CLI live prices](./done/m8/README.md) (7 tasks) ← PRFAQ003 launch gaps; requested 2026-09-21

- [x] **m9** — [Complete a first month through the installed ledger skills](./done/m9/README.md) (8 tasks, ~5h) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w5`, all three proposals approved with `$pm all for w5` on 2026-09-27

- [x] **m10** — [Migrate an export and continue importing without duplicate transfers](./done/m10/README.md) (9 tasks, ~6h) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w5`, both proposals approved with `$pm for both to w5` on 2026-09-28

- [x] **m11** — [Publish the CLI fixes required by the migration journey](./done/m11/README.md) (8 tasks, ~5h) ← `/pm-brainstorm more for w5`, all three proposals approved with `$pm all for w5` on 2026-09-28

- [x] **m12** — [Graduate a CSV workflow into a tested, maintainable importer](./done/m12/README.md) (9 tasks, ~6h) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w5`, both proposals approved with `$pm for all for w5` on 2026-09-28

- [ ] **m13** — [Install the ledger skills and reach a first query on native Windows](./blocked/m13/README.md) (8 tasks, ~5½h) ← `/pm-brainstorm for w5`, both proposals approved with `$pm for all for w5` on 2026-09-28 — **blocked:** native Windows host access is required

## Dropped

- ~~**032**~~ — Catalog search `private` filter validated but inert — dropped 2026-10-02: the finding reads an include flag as an only filter. The upstream search takes `private` (include private ledgers the caller can see, on by default) and `is_private` (only private ones) as separate parameters, and the three transcripts — `private=true`, `private=false`, no filter — are each consistent with that. Mapping `private` onto `is_private`, or rejecting it, would break a working parameter. Re-file as a documentation note if the two names prove confusing in practice.
- ~~**044**~~ — Mistyped list cursor returns -32603 with a raw Zod dump — dropped 2026-10-02: a numeric `cursor` or a `tools/call` with no `name` is a malformed protocol envelope that no conforming MCP client sends, and the MCP SDK's dispatcher refuses it before any handler of ours runs. Re-coding it means overriding the SDK's own request validation for every list method, for an input only a hand-written probe produces.
- ~~**049**~~ — Responses without `Origin` carry an empty `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` — dropped 2026-10-02: no caller can observe a difference. A request with no `Origin` is not a cross-origin browser request, an empty allow-origin grants nothing, and non-browser clients ignore the header.
- ~~**050**~~ — PUT/PATCH get the router's plain-text 405 — dropped 2026-10-02: PUT and PATCH are not MCP transport methods and no client sends them; the router's standard 405 is already a correct refusal. The in-band, authenticated 405 that ADR007 D9 asks for covers GET and DELETE, the two methods the transport defines.
- ~~**052**~~ — Missing rename source refused BAD_USER_INPUT, not NOT_FOUND — dropped 2026-10-02: the note records the throw as deliberate and offers "or document the category" as a fix. Its sibling for comparison gets NOT_FOUND only by accident of wording (see [036](./done/036.md)), and the one real question — which code a missing file should carry on the edit and rename paths — is already in [051](./done/051.md).
- ~~**466**~~ — SIGTERM/SIGHUP to `treeify`/`doctor`/`example` leaves the upstream child running — dropped 2026-10-15: duplicates open [437](./437.md), which covers the same `capture_native` gap for `example`, `treeify` and doctor captures, plus cloud `git clone` and `upgrade`; the work stays tracked there.

## Inbox

- [974 — Retain known native IDs when cash depends on a booked lot](./974.md) — reopened major CLI duplicate gap; a filtered repayment or stock sale with inferred Cash and an open selector loses its written bank owner. Repeats duplicate 65 USD outflow or 300 USD receipt; controls and both repetitions verified 2026-10-23.

- [913 — Warn for funded accounts a native import closes through close_tree](./913.md) — reopened minor CLI warning gap; a parent import closes its funded child/grandchild without a preview/apply warning. Explicit closes and drained/previously closed controls work; reproduced twice 2026-10-23.

- [1015 — Compare opening methods, currency sets and balance tolerances](./1015.md) — minor CLI provenance gaps; known LIFO/tolerance changes falsely count as written, while equivalent currency lists hide real openings. Valid native fixtures and imports reproduce twice, 2026-10-23.

- [1014 — Anchor payment references to their written metadata](./1014.md) — major CLI silent omission; calculated native or generated references make real payments skip while their IDs are absent from the file, reproduced twice across CSV/Python and actual generated-ID producers, 2026-10-23.

- [1013 — Match inferred and explicit source postings without consuming the wrong line](./1013.md) — reopened remaining major CLI matching gap after 8d1566b42; an inferred Cash line is consumed too early and the same statement doubles USD/EUR expenses despite duplicate skip, reproduced twice 2026-10-23.


- [1011 — Preserve written postings across cost inference and lot splitting](./1011.md) — major CLI normalization gaps; split total-cost sales can duplicate 500 USD, and a native-valid inferred total blocks listing/new import with a TypeError. Native arithmetic-order mismatch also duplicates a 3 USD settlement. Prior precise-fact scope retained; reproduced twice 2026-10-23.

























The 27 findings from the MCP QA auth sweep against the hosted endpoint (023–054, less the five under [Dropped](#dropped)) were fixed in `backend-cluster/backend-v2` and closed on 2026-10-02 and 2026-10-03; each note under [`done/`](./done/) records what shipped and in which commit. None has been re-observed against the hosted endpoint yet — the fixes reach it with the next backend deploy.

## Blocked inbox

- [431 — `add balance`/`add price`/bare-number adds load the ledger twice for pre-checks](./blocked/431.md) — blocked on a maintainer choice between a pre-commit hook in the shared write validation and plugin-free pre-checks that change refusals.
- [015 — Decide the supported way to give a custom importer a third-party dependency](./blocked/015.md) — blocked on the CLI product owner's choice of the supported environment; the new work does not depend on this decision.

## Execution notes

**Approved sequence:** m12 → m13. m12 completed on 2026-09-29 with both installed-agent journeys on published bea 0.3.1; its guide, independent checkpoints, header repair, and sandbox-cache correction are shipped. m13 is parked until a native Windows host is accessible; all eight tasks depend on that baseline, and live-client acceptance additionally needs both native agents authenticated. Neither milestone changes blocked m5 or 015.

Blocked milestones live under `blocked/` with their reason and unblock condition in a `## Blocked` section; they keep their task IDs and return to `wN/mN/` when work can resume.

As of 2026-09-29, m10, m11, m12 and inbox 019–022 are complete. `beancount-io` 0.3.1 (tag `cli-v0.3.1`) is published to PyPI and Homebrew, and the migration journey passed on it in both clients. m9 and inbox 016–018 are complete. m5 and 015 retain their recorded external unblock conditions. w5 remains a general-purpose adoption queue.

The earlier sequence was m3 → m4 → m5. Real-client MCP journeys run against the hosted endpoint, not a duplicate stack. m3 and m4 have no dependency on each other; m5/t001 depends on m4/t009. The customer skill installation work in m3 builds on w1/m21's completed accounting-engine integration. The larger Plaid sandbox journey remains an explicit deferred follow-up in w2/009. m5 verifies and repairs the four prompts already shipped by w2/008; it does not recreate their registration or bodies.

Authenticated CLI live-price milestones m6 → m7 → m8 completed with CLI 0.3.0 on 2026-09-21. The existing m5 blocker remains independent.
